Testing is using code to write "Tests" that ensure
your code is running correctly
A test suite is a collection of tests
This reduces bugs and speeds up coding time

Why test?
Tests protect against regression, when a feature suddenly stops working
Tests allow better refactoring, changing code form but not function
Tests act as a client allowing you to see design cohe

When to test?
required test code is short compared to app code
when security is important
when a bug is found,reproduce it,test, fix it
test before refactor
integration tests come second

Test driven development:
1. write failing tests
2. write code to get the tests to pass
